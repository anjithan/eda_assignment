## General Information
We have been given dataset of a financial institution where loans are approved.
From the dataset, we have defaulters as charged off in loan status or good payers in fully paid status.
We need to analyze the data to see if we can derive useful information as to who would be defaulter or not.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 - Loans are being taken usually at the end of the year
- Conclusion 2 - Loans between 5000 to 15000 are very common and above 30000 are outliers
- Conclusion 3 - Higher number of loans are being taken by members with experience of 10+ years followed by new employees with below 1 year experience
- Conclusion 4 - Loan amount is found highest as the grades go up, in other words, grade A members are least and grade G members highest in taking loans
- Conclusion 5 - Following to conclusion 4, we can see interest rate and revolving credit also increasing with the grades
- Conclusion 6 - A surprising observation is members of F & G grade taking loans in 11th month or November are at higher risk of default
